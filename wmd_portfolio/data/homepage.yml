  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    I love strategizing and solving problems. My passion is data science. But, when I am not learning, building, or creating solutions,
    I enjoy spending time with my family. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is applying data science to business 
    to create value for companies by understanding the financial
    cost of problems, and delivering a return-on-investment by providing data-informed solutions.
